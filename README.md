## âš¡ Quick Start Guide

To get StudyNotion up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/study_notion.git
    cd study_notion
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to both the client (root) and server directories and install the required packages.

    ```bash
    # For the frontend (in the root directory)
    npm install
    # or yarn install

    # For the backend (in the server directory)
    cd server
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    cd .. # Go back to the root directory
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in both the root directory (for frontend environment variables, if any) and the `server` directory. Populate them with your respective credentials.

    **`server/.env` example:**
    ```
    MONGO_DB_URL="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"
    JWT_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_JWT_SECRET"
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET"
    MAIL_HOST="YOUR_MAIL_HOST"
    MAIL_USER="YOUR_MAIL_USER"
    MAIL_PASS="YOUR_MAIL_PASS"
    RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID"
    RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET="YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET"
    PORT=4000
    FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    # Start the backend server (from the root directory)
    cd server
    npm start # or 'npm run dev' if configured
    # In a new terminal, start the frontend
    cd .. # Go back to root
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```

    The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` and the backend on `http://localhost:4000` (or your configured ports).
