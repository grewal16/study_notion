The core architecture follows a client-server model, with a React frontend interacting with a Node.js/Express.js backend. Data is persisted in a MongoDB database, with relationships managed through Mongoose.

The database schema is designed for an e-learning application, incorporating users, courses, categories, sections, lectures (sub-sections), progress tracking, ratings, and more.
