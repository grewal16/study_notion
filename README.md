## âš¡ Quick Start Guide

To get Study Notion up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/study_notion.git
    cd study_notion
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   **Frontend (React App):**
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **Backend (Node.js/Express):**
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm install
        cd ..
        ```

3.  **Environment Variables Setup:**
    Create a `.env` file in both the root directory (for the frontend) and the `server` directory (for the backend).
    *   **`server/.env` (Backend Example):**
        ```
        PORT=4000
        MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/studynotion?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
        JWT_SECRET="YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY"
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
        MAIL_USER="your_email@example.com"
        MAIL_PASS="your_email_app_password"
        RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="rzp_test_yourkeyid"
        RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET="rzp_test_yourkeysecret"
        ```
    *   **`.env` (Frontend Example - in root, if needed, otherwise handled by proxy):**
        ```
        REACT_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4000/api/v1"
        ```

4.  **Start the Application:**
    *   **Start Backend Server:**
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm start
        ```
    *   **Start Frontend Development Server:**
        ```bash
        cd ..
        npm start
        ```
    Your application should now be running! Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your frontend).
